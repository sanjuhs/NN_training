Before we make a research paper, there are different parts for the research paper.

The different parts for the research paper currently are as follows:

1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Related Work
4. Other Related Work
5. Part 3: Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks
6. 3.1: Explanation of the TCN and why we chose it
7. 3.2: Any of the additions that we added to the TCN to make it suit our implementation better and the normalization that we did and other parts that we did
8. 3.3: How we actually implemented everything - the maths behind it: how big the network is, the inputs/outputs, the matching, the thing that we used: PyTorch. All of that and maybe some other interesting information
9. Part 4: Evaluation Discussion
10. Then Metrics And under Metrics we have different metrics when we did the training And then we have some Experiments
11. Part 4.5 or 5 is Experiments where we check how many neurons are dead, how many are alive, and Can we ablate some and what happens?
12. Datasets
13. The last part, Part 6, is Results - Experimental Results
14. Part 6.5 is Training Time Receptive Fields
15. Part 7 is basically a conclusion
16. References All of this needs to be filled up one by one.

For each of the parts, we can make a Markdown file and put the content one-by-one. We can start with:

1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Related work
4. FAQ
