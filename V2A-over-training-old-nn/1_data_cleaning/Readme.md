Here to do data cleaning what we will do is we will first extract every frame using cv2 or ffmpeg and then we will use each frame, pass it to MediaPipe and we will extract the frames' landmarks and from that we will then extract the blend shapes. That's basically what we'll do. This script will go over the data that is present in the data folder and will clean it and will then generate a JSON that will then be stored in the data folder itself and this will be called 1_data_cleaned_blend_shapes.json.
